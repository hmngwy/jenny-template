# Hello World

Jenny is a static blog generator using bash, sed, and awk.

it works!

I decided to switch because this way is much more simple, I took out the old tools:

  * hugo
  * two repos, one to content and other with published content(render to html)
  * bash scripts to automate publish proccess

[Jenny](https://github.com/hmngwy/jenny) delivery a very simple way to publish content in github-pages.

Now I need to:

    * Bring the content from my old content repo(thanks markdown!)
    * Improve the layout
    * Post, post, post

I don't need special tools to create html from makrdown and now I am just a simple commit in github-pages repo
(thanks Jenny and github workflows)
